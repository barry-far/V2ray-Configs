## Usage
üëâ To use one of these configurations, simply open the configs.txt file located in the root directory. This file contains a list of links to various 2ray configuration files that you can use with your V2ray client. Copy [THIS LINK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barry-far/V2ray-Configs/main/All_Configs_Sub.txt) link of the configuration file you want to use from the configs.txt file and import it into your V2ray client. Refer to your client's documentation for more information on how to do this.

Just Copy these links to your client to use :

## Requirements and How to Use
üì≤ Here are best ways to use V2ray on different operating systems:

### üíª Windows and üêß Linux
On Windows, we recommend using [Hiddify-Next](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-next) or [Nekoray](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/nekoray) client. To import a configuration file in `nekoray`, simply open the app then on the Program icon, select "Add profile from clipboard", and paste the configuration link. To import a configuration file in `Hiddify`, simply click on the + icon at top right, select "Add from clipboard", and paste the configuration link.

### ü§ñ Android
On Android, we recommend using [V2rayNG](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG) or [HiddifyNext](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-next/releases).
